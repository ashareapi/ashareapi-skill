# ashareapi — Official Agent Skill for the A-Share Data API

An A-share endpoint manual **written for AI agents** — drop it into your skills directory and the agent knows **which endpoint to call, how to fill the parameters, what unit each field is in, and what to do on errors** (33 endpoints / 25 MCP tools).

## What this is

An **A-share data Agent Skill**: a set of operating instructions written for an AI agent, plus reference documents loaded on demand. Once installed, when the agent answers questions like "how much is this stock right now" or "screen for stocks with PE<20 and ROE>15", it **knows which endpoint to call and how to read the response** — instead of making things up.

**5 endpoints need no key** (usable right after installation): `/v1/quote` · `/v1/kline` · `/v1/hot` · `/v1/market-overview` · `/v1/changedist`. The rest need a key ([get one](https://ashareapi.com/en/pricing/) from ¥9.9).

## Why use it

- **It gives AI "knowledge", not a "tool"**: MCP lets the agent call tools itself; a Skill lets the agent **know** which endpoint to call, what unit a field is in, and what to do on errors. They are complementary — install both if you like
- **It ships a decision tree**: the agent finds the endpoint by task ("how much now" → `quote`; "recent trend" → `kline`; "which sectors are rising" → `sector`)
- **All four must-know semantics are spelled out**: units (lots / yuan / percent) · numbers are strings · date formats · response structures — without these, whatever the AI computes is wrong
- **Errors and rate limits are covered too**: the difference between 401 / 429 / `ok:false` / empty results, and how to raise your quota when the anonymous limit is hit
- **Loaded on demand, so it does not eat context**: the 4 reference files are read only when needed, not dumped into the AI all at once
- **Pure files, no server**: copy one folder into your skills directory — no URL to configure, no service to start

## Installation

**① Hand it to your AI agent** (the easiest — copy this line and send it):

> Please install this ashareapi Agent Skill for me: download `https://ashareapi.com/ashareapi-skill.zip` and extract it into your skills directory (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`). When done, confirm the directory contains `ashareapi/SKILL.md` and `ashareapi/references/`.

**② One command** (macOS / Linux / WSL — replace `~/.claude/skills` with your client's directory):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cd ~/.claude/skills && curl -sL https://ashareapi.com/ashareapi-skill.zip -o s.zip && unzip -oq s.zip && rm s.zip
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
iwr https://ashareapi.com/ashareapi-skill.zip -OutFile s.zip; Expand-Archive s.zip -DestinationPath "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills" -Force; rm s.zip
```

**③ Manually**: download the zip from <https://ashareapi.com/en/skill/> and extract it into your skills directory:

```bash
unzip ashareapi-skill.zip -d ~/.claude/skills/     # Claude Code
```

**Restart your client after installing.** You can also clone this repo and put `SKILL.md` plus `references/` into `skills/ashareapi/`.

### Client directories

**8 mainstream clients** (paths checked against official docs):

| Client | Global (all projects) | In-project (committed to git) |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | `.opencode/skills/` |
| Cursor | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `~/.codex/skills/` | `.codex/skills/` |
| Antigravity (Google) | `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| VS Code / GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `.github/skills/` |
| WorkBuddy | — | `.workbuddy/skills/` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `~/.dsh/skills/` | `.dsh/skills/` |

> Not sure which one to use? `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` are "universal directories" that Claude Code / opencode / Cursor / Antigravity / DeepSeek Harness can all read.

**The other 40 clients** (installation paths follow each vendor's official docs):

Junie (JetBrains) · OpenHands · Goose (Block) · Amp · Kiro (AWS) · TRAE · Command Code · Roo Code · Cline · Factory (Droids) · Deep Code · Mistral AI Vibe · Letta · Mux (Coder) · Emdash · OpenClaw · Hermes Agent · Qodo · Tabnine · Snowflake Cortex Code · Databricks Genie Code · Spring AI · Laravel Boost · Pulumi Neo · Superconductor · Ona · pi · VT Code · fast-agent · bub · nanobot · ZeroClaw · Autohand Code CLI · Firebender · Vita · Agentman · Workshop · Piebald · Google AI Edge Gallery · Claude (claude.ai)

## Version

**Current version: `0.2.7`** — version history and how to update: see [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) §9.

> ⚠️ **The API itself never needs updating** — endpoints are always current (the service evolves server-side); what needs updating is **this manual**.
